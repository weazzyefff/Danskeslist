This is a Craigslist clone

I've used BeautifulSoup to web scrape Craigslist for the HTML tag classes used. 

I've then used these HTML class tags to pull the images and links to each title class, and img class. 

Done by following the tutorial here - https://cleverprogrammer.teachable.com/courses/653091/lectures/11656076
Didn't quite get the image resizing to work, nor did i get it hosted using Django_Heroku. 
Still quite a good exercise.

NOTE: The CSS style sheet is getting a 404 when running. Not sure why??
